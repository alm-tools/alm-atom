# WHY?

I love TypeScript and created [`alm`][alm]. Sometimes I want / friends want to use atom, so make it easier for everyone to use [alm][alm] :rose:

# Usage

Just `apm install alm` and then you get the command `alm`. Whenever you execute the command, `alm` will open in a new electron window. Just close the window to exit alm at any point. Simples 🌹
